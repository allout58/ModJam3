!!!!WARNING!!!!
========
This mod is meant for multiplayer. If you jail yourself in a singleplayer world, there is currently only one way to get out.  You must close the world, go to the world save folder, and look for a file named PrisonCraftPerms.txt and add your username and "-1" to it. Then reopen your world and you should be able to unjail yourself.
