PrisonCraft
========

My mod for ModJam 3

This mod allows you to create jails similar to the Bukkit plugin.
(More details and possibly a YouTube tutorial to come)

!!!!WARNING!!!!
========
This mod is meant for multiplayer. If you jail yourself in a singleplayer world, there is currently only one way to get out.  You must close the world, go to the world save folder, and look for a file named PrisonCraftPerms.txt and add your username to it. Then reopen your world and you should be able to unjail yourself.
